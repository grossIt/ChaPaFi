Automatic identification of parameters for 3-backstresses Chaboche kinematic hardening model, starting from uniaxial strain-controlled experimental tests and an optional ratcheting test.

The mathematical procedure is described in the article:

**C. Santus, T. Grossi, M. Benedetti, "Identification of Chaboche kinematic hardening model parameters to simulate stabilized cycles and ratcheting behavior: theoretical advances and an efficient semianalytical procedure", March 2022**

The article is currently under peer review in an international journal. 
Files will be available once that the article is published.
