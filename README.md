Automatic identification of parameters for 3-backstresses Chaboche kinematic hardening model, starting from uniaxial strain-controlled experimental tests and an optional ratcheting test.

The mathematical procedure is described in the article:

**C. Santus, T. Grossi, L. Romanelli, M. Pedranz, M. Benedetti, "A computationally fast and accurate procedure for the identification of the Chaboche isotropic-kinematic hardening model parameters based on strain-controlled cycles and asymptotic ratcheting rate", November 2022**
