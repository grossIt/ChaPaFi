Automatic identification of parameters for 3-backstresses Chaboche kinematic hardening model, starting from uniaxial strain-controlled cyclic tests and an optional ratcheting test.

The mathematical procedure is described in the article:

A computationally fast and accurate procedure for the identification of the Chaboche isotropic-kinematic hardening model parameters based on strain-controlled cycles and asymptotic ratcheting rate.
